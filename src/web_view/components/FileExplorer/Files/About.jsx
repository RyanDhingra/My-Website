            <p className='about-file-txt'>Hello there! My name is Ryan, and I'm currently a Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University. I've worked multiple terms as a Co-op at Sun Life Financial, gaining experience in software development, cloud technologies, and DevOps. In addition to my studies, I freelance in software and web development, helping clients build tailored web applications. I'm passionate about exploring areas like machine learning, computer vision, and cybersecurity. Outside of tech, I'm a former varsity badminton player and volunteer coach. I'm always open to connecting with new people and exploring exciting opportunities!</p>
